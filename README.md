# Banker-s-Algorithm

The C file contains a banker's algorithm code to avoid deadlocks.
The code test for safety by simulating the allocation for maximum possible amounts of all resources, then check whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
The first screenshot illustrate the case in which the deadlock occurs. In this case the code will break and it will show that "Deadlock has occured"
The second screenshot shows that the sequence satisfies safety requirement. And it will ask you if you wuld like to continue and make any additional request or not.
